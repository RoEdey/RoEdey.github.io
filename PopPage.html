	      <p>I was meeting a man from Tinder, we were meeting in a local pub. When I arrived he told me he was already there wearing a burgandy hat... I found a man, who looked like his pictures sitting alone in a reddish hat, so assumed it was him. I sat down, started chatting (immediately, he was super hot!), when I realised he was looking at me strangely. On closer inspection... it was the WRONG MAN. I went bright red, made my apologies and ran away. The horror story ends well though, his friend bumped into me on my way to the loo and gave me his number, we've been dating ever since ;)</p>

	      <p>It was my first date with this guy that my friend set me up with. We decided it would be fun if I picked the date venue. I thought long and hard about it and decided that all men love stake, right? Wrong. We arrive at the restaurant that specialises in all things meaty, as we look at the menu I am excited and all the delicious treats make me feel like I've made the correct choice. Wrong again. He was VEGAN. He couldn't even drink the wine. We stuck it out and he ended up having bread and soda water, as I tried to not salivate too much over my beef...</p>
